What's that?

In short, it's a program for detecting delays in local network using mdns protocol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS
Don't remember details, to be honest. Code looks nice tho, you can't deny it.

Why?

To pass one of university classes during second year.

Why is it here?

I felt quite cool when I was writing it. Didn't want to lose it. Also, did I mention that code looks nice?

How to run it?

Don't remember. But if you are reading this and for some reason are interested - ping me. There is a chance I will recall it from code, should be one or two commands from shell. Oh, also libevent library will be necessary.
